# Object Oriented Programming in Java

This was my first course in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It covered the basics, including objects, classes, and constructors in Java syntax. Containers like arrays, queues, and maps were explained for managing objects, along with the use of generics to avoid type errors. Exception handling was taught to separate errors from main logic. Packages were used for organizing programs, streams for input/output, and threads for better performance. Design patterns were introduced to create efficient and well-structured software.
